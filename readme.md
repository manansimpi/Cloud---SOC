# Security Operations Center Simulation in Azure Cloud

## Project Description
- This project involves simulating a Security Operations Center (SOC) within the Azure Cloud environment to evaluate the effectiveness of cloud-native tools and technologies in identifying, responding to, and mitigating cybersecurity threats. The simulation aims to emulate real-world attack scenarios, test incident detection and response workflows, and strengthen the overall security posture of an Azure-based infrastructure.
- Azure's robust suite of security tools, including Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Defender, and Log Analytics, is used to monitor and analyze security telemetry. Various scenarios, such as phishing attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and malware infections, are simulated to replicate adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- The project focuses on leveraging threat intelligence, custom KQL queries, and automated playbooks for incident detection and remediation. The simulation also evaluates the integration of Azure security solutions with organizational workflows and identifies gaps or inefficiencies in existing processes.
- By conducting this simulation, the project provides actionable insights into SOC operations, enhances the incident response strategy, and ensures compliance with industry best practices for cloud security.
